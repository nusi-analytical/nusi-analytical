The purpose of this GitHub profile is to store sanitized code from former projects I worked on.  This repo will contain R code that is readily executable with access to the YouTube API for data collection, OpenAI API for some processing tasks, and a Google account for dissimenation of reports/data sets.

References can be provided upon request to clarify the nature of my work if so needed.
